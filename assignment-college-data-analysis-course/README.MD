### 1. Bitcoin Prices
Here is a list of Bitcoin prices recorded at the end of each week (Sunday) in 2018 and 2019.
Create a visualization that allows you to answer the question:
In which year did bitcoin holders have more profits?

```python

### 2. CPU Usage
The following data is the average hourly CPU usage for a workerâ€™s computer over the course of a week. Each row of data represents a day of the week starting with Monday. Each column of data represents an hour of the day starting with 0 to midnight.
Use data visualization to answer the following questions:
- What time does the worker typically eat lunch?
- Does the worker work on weekends?
- What day of the week does the worker start working on their computer in the evening?

```python
cpu_usage = [[2, 2, 4, 2, 4, 1, 1, 4, 4, 12, 22, 23, 45, 9, 33, 56, 23, 40, 21, 6, 6, 2, 2, 3],
             [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 7, 22, 45, 44, 33, 9, 23, 19, 33, 56, 12, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2],
             [2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 4, 2, 2, 1, 2, 5, 31, 54, 7, 6, 34, 68, 34, 49, 6, 6, 2, 2, 3],
             [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1, 17, 24, 18, 41, 3, 44, 42, 12, 36, 41, 2, 2, 4, 2, 4],
             [4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 5, 1, 2, 12, 33, 27, 43, 8, 38, 53, 29, 45, 39, 3, 1, 1, 3, 4],
             [2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 5, 2, 8, 4, 2, 3, 1, 5, 1, 2, 3, 2, 6, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 3],
             [1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 4, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 5, 3, 2, 1, 4, 2, 45, 26, 33, 2, 2, 1]]
